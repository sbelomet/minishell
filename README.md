# ðŸ’¾ Minishell ðŸ’¾

`Making a simplified shell, based on bash`

### Objectives

We had to code a shell from scratch in C. It had to be able to display a prompt, execute commands, handle quotes, pipes, redirections, environment variables and signals. We also had to implement built-in commands (echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit)

### Usage

Prerequisites: This was coded on Mac, the readline library needs to be installed (the include paths in the Makefile may need to be changed)
1. `make`
2. `./minishell`
3. exit or Ctrl+D on empty line to quit the program
